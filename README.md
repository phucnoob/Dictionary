## Dictionary App
*This project is assigment for author university course*

### It has two versions.

This is the GUI written in JavaFX.<br>
The commandline version in the [commandline branch](https://github.com/phucnoob/Dictionary/tree/commandline)

## Notice!! Important
I designed and dev the app in my laptop,
which has 1920x1080 resolution and 100% scaling.
I'm not sure if JavaFX has some hDPI handling so
if the window is too small (or big), please change your screen config to mine.
